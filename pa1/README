In this programming assignment, I created a doubly linked list that contains a cursor attribute. The cursor is simply just a reference to a node in the list that can be moved forwards or backwards at the client's discretion. "Lex.c" is a client of "List.c" and uses the cursor to indirectly sort the elements of the list.
