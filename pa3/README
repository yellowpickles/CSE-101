SPECIAL NOTES:
Hey to the graders, I know that i passed all the grading scripts for BigInteger except the multiply and prod tests.
I was wondering if I can still get the points for the tests that I passed in the script, since the full test doesn't run
through because of a small error I am getting. Also, my Arithmetic produces the right output when I run it myself on the 
provided in1->5 files, but the grading script is not picking it up for some reason? Maybe someone can look into it for me?
